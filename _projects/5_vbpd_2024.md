This project is funded by [Virginia Board for People with Disabilities](https://vbpd.virginia.gov/grantee/mapping-information-ecology-understanding-the-fragmentation-of-disability/).

<!-- This research focuses on Medicaid services for people with developmental disabilities in Virginia, aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding of the information ecology. [Project Description](https://vbpd.virginia.gov/grantee/mapping-information-ecology-understanding-the-fragmentation-of-disability/) -->

I co-authored the grant proposal, developed an LLM-assisted framework to analyze large-scale survey data on disability information sources, and implemented computational network analysis to map information fragmentation.
