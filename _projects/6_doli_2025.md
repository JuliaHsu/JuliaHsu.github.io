<!-- Using predictive models, the computational approach developed for SAFETI estimates the likelihood of a fatality occurring within a specific time frame and sector, along with its associated probability.

I mentored Ph.D, Master's and undergraduate research fellows on data analysis and modeling, and designed and implemented deep learning models to predict occupational injuries and fatalities.
