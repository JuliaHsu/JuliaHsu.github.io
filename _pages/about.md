I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Information Technology with a concentration in Information Sciences and Technology at the [School of Computing](https://computing.gmu.edu/), [George Mason University](https://www.gmu.edu/). My research focuses on Computational Social Sciences and Information Sciences, where I apply data-driven and computational methods to study social phenomena and improve information access. My broader interests include Computational Social Sciences, AI for social good, Community Informatics, Civic Technology, and Health Informatics.

I am currently a Graduate Research Assistant working with [Dr. Myeong Lee](https://myeonglee.com/) at the [Community Informatics Lab](https://cil.cec.gmu.edu/), where I collaborate on projects that leverage computational approaches to address societal challenges.
